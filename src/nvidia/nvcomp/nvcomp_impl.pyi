def set_device_allocator(allocator: typing.Any = None) -> None:
    """
                Sets a new allocator to be used for future device allocations.
    
                The signature of the allocator should be like in the following example::
    
                    def my_allocator(nbytes: int, stream: nvcomp.Stream) -> PtrProtocol:
                        return MyBuffer(nbytes, stream)
                
                `PtrProtocol` denotes any object that has a `ptr` attribute of integral type.
                This should be the pointer to the allocated buffer (represented as an integer).
                
                In the signature, `nbytes` is the number of bytes in the requested buffer.
                `stream` is the CUDA stream on which to perform the allocation and/or deallocation
                if the allocator is stream-ordered. Non-stream-ordered allocators may ignore
                `stream` or may synchronize with it before deallocation, depending on the desired
                behavior. A separate allocation and deallocation stream are currently not supported.
    
                The returned object should be such that, when it is deleted, either on account of there
                being no more valid Python references to it or because it was garbage collected, the
                memory gets deallocated. In a custom Python class, this may be achieved through
                the `__del__` method. This is considered an advanced usage pattern, so
                the recommended approach is to compose pre-existing solutions from other
                libraries, such as cupy's `Memory` classes and rmm's `DeviceBuffer`.
    
                It is generally allowed to set a new allocator while one or more buffers
                allocated by the previous allocator are still active. Individual allocator
                implementations may, however, choose to prohibit this.
    
                If the deallocation requires accessing `stream`, the allocator should return
                an `ExternalMemory` instance wrapping the newly constructed memory object and the `CudaStream` argument.
                The memory object should, from then on, only be accessed through the `ExternalMemory` wrapper.
                This ensures that the stream is still alive when the memory is deallocated.
    
                A simple but versatile example of a custom allocator is given by `rmm_nvcomp_allocator`.
    
                The allocated memory must be device-accessible.
    
                Args:
                    allocator: Callable satisfying the conditions above.

    """
                Sets a new allocator to be used for future non-pinned host allocations.
    
                This is primarily intended for potentially large allocations,
                such as those backing CPU Array instances. Moderately-sized internal
                host allocations may still use System Allocated Memory.

                host memory with this allocator but may lead to performance degradation.
    
                The allocator must allocate host accessible memory. Other than that, the conditions on
                `allocator` are the same as in `set_device_allocator`, including stream semantics.
